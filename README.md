A simple script to extract the jdk installer without install it.

Usage:

Put the script (install.cmd), 7z tool (7z.exe) and jdk installer (jdk-8u171-windows-x64.exe) under same folder, 
and run install.cmd. That's all.

You may need to add ./bin/ folder to PATH environment variable manually and update the JAVA_HOME/JDK_HOME environment variable.


**For JDK 11, Oracle has provided .zip package (Finally) so no need for this script**
